# Bloxtrap

**What is this repository?** — this is a repository containing a Fast Flags JSON archive for optimizing Roblox through a custom launcher - Bloxtrap.

## Description
Fast Flags ("fast flags") — This is a tool for editing Roblox Roblox parameters. This archive was created to improve performance, customize the gaming experience and fix known problems with launching Roblox.

## Repository composition
- **Default Fast flags.json**: The main JSON file containing the Fast flag parameters and values.
- **SUPER fastflags.json**: The second main JSON file, only personally compiled for the author, contains more optimization of the game launch, etc.
- **README**: Instructions for installing flags and all useful information.
- **README-RU**: Instructions for installing flags and all useful information on the Russian Lang.
## Features
1. The configuration does not contain potentially conflicting parameters, which makes it suitable for all Roblox modes.
2. The configuration does not turn the graphics into "potatoes" and gently changes the graphics, while providing a good FPS increase.
3. Using this optimization method eliminates the possibility of a ban, since Fast Flag is an internal Roblox parameter, and Bloxstrap in this situation is just a tool for changing them, while also providing a modern, concise, functional and beautiful launcher.
